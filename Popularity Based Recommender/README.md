# Popularity Based Model

The goal of this recommendation model is to first choose the movies with the highest ratings received. 
Once the popular movies have been extracted, I fetch the movies that havent been rated by the given userId yet.
This model suggests those popular movies that have not been rated by an user.
Presumably if a movie is not rated  by the user it hasnot been seen y the user as well
