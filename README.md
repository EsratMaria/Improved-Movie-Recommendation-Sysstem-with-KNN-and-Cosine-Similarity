# Recommendation System 

Recommendation systems improve the quality of search results and provide elements that are more relevant to the search item or that are related to the search history of the user.
Recommendation systems are widely used to recommend movies, items, restaurants, places to visit, items to buy, etc.

## Types of recommendation System


- **Popularity Based:** It keeps a track of view counts for each movie/video and then lists movies based on views in descending order.

- **Content Based:** This type of recommendation system, takes in a movie that a user currently likes as input. Then it analyzes the contents of the movie to find out other movies which have similar content. Then it ranks similar movies according to their similarity scores and recommends the most relevant movies to the user.

- **Collaborative filtering:** In this category, the recommendations get filtered based on the collaboration between similar userâ€™s preferences.

**In this repository,** I tried making a movie recommendation system that suggests relevant movies according to a user's interest and previously rated movies.
