# Recommendation System 

Recommendation systems improve the quality of search results and provide elements that are more relevant to the search item or that are related to the search history of the user.
Recommendation systems are widely used to recommend movies, items, restaurants, places to visit, items to buy, etc.

In this repository, I tried making a movie recommendation system that suggests relevant movies according to a user's interest and previously rated movies.
